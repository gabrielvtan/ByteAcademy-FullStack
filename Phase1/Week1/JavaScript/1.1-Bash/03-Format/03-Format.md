## Day 1 Exercise 3 - Formatting and documentation.

* This is an exercise in string formatting but also in reading documentation!

[https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html] has the documentation for how .format works.

* You might also want to search questions and answers at the website [stackoverflow.com] - it's every programmer's best friend.

* Note, you are using python3 (probably 3.5 or 3.6) in this course! When you look for documentation, make sure it is not python2. There is a lot of older python2 code still out there and people still talk about it, and some articles aren't very recent. It is always a good idea to pay attention to the date on any programming article or blog post.

#### The exercise:

* Using .format() and print() do the following in a single program.

* Store 3 and 'little pigs' in two variables. Print the string "The 3 little pigs" using those 2 variables.

* Store the number 6.7 in a variable, then make it print as 6.700

* Store the strings "Sam" and "Josephine" into variables. Print the text

```
The joint account for Sam          and Josephine    has $1000.
```

* Where each name and the extra black space combine to 12 characters wide.

* Do the same, but make the names display all the way to the right of the twelve spaces.

#### Hint:

* If you type 'python' on the terminal, you can enter the interactive mode (the REPL) this is a good place to experiment and do trial and error to figure out how things work. Nothing you do there is saved to a file.
