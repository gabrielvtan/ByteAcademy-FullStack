# Turning in Your Work

* Turn in your exercises before the next day's lecture.

* Make sure the answer to each exercise (or as many as you have completed) is in each folder.

* Don't stress out! Exercises are not graded, they are for learning. Try hard and do as much as you can.

* Once you are done, create a .zip file of your day1 folder and send it to your instructor in a direct message on Slack.

* Make the name have your name and day1 in it. No spaces please! Something like carter-day1.zip

* To create a zip on Windows, right click on the day1 folder and select 'Send To' and then 'Compressed (zipped) Folder'. You'll be asked to name the file.

* To create a zip on Mac, right-click or Command-click on the day1 folder and click 'Compress Items.' This will create a file called 'day1.zip.' Click on the file by selecting it and hitting 'return' or clicking on the name again.

* Different Linux distributions have different graphical zip programs. Or if you are familiar with the command line, use documentation to figure out the zip command. gzipped tar files are accepted.

* Don't worry if you didn't get everything done! We'll go over the code.
