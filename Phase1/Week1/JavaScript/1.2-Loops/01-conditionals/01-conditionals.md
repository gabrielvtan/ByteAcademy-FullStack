# Day 2, Exercise 1 - Basic Conditionals

#### Do the following in a single program

* Use input() to prompt the user to enter an integer and use int() to convert the string to an integer value. Store the result in a variable.

* If the number is equal to zero, print "It is zero!" If it is not, print "It's not zero!"

* If the number is less than 10 print "Less than 10!" If it's greater than 10 and it is less than 20 print "Less than 20!" Otherwise, print "Big number you got there!" Use one 'if' one 'elif' and one 'else.'

* If the number is greater than or equal to 0 and less than but not equal to 100, print it out using .format() so it is always two digits (03 for 3 for instance)

* If the number is even print "It is even!"

* If the number is divisible by 5 print "It is divisible by five!"

* If a number is divisible by 13 or it is divisible by 17, print "Cicadas!"

* If the number is both even and divisible by 5 print "It is both even and divisible by 5!" (Don't just check for divisibility by 10)

* If you answered the last question using 'and' answer it with an if statement inside of an if statement. If you answered the last question using a nested if, answer it with 'and'

* If the number is not divisible by seven, update the variable by multiplying it by 7. Otherwise divide it by 2. After updating the number, print "The new number is <number> now."

* Be sure to test each possibility.
