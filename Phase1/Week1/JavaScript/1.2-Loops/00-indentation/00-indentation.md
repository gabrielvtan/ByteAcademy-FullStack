## Day 2 - Exercise 0 - Indentation

* You do not need to turn in anything for this exercise.

* Copy the following code into your editor and run it:

```python

if 2 > 1:
    print("Yes")
print("It is!")

if 1 > 2:
    print("I think...")
    print("No!")
print("It isn't!")
```

Do you understand why the last line did print, and the second to last one did not?

* This code has an error, copy it into your editor, see the error message and then try to fix it.

```python
if 1 == 1 is True:
    print("A thing is itself.")
     print("Doesn't it have to be?")
```

* This code also has an error. Try to fix it.

```python
print("Hello ", end="")
    print("World!")
```

* Try to write an if statement in the python REPL. You'll need to manually input tabs

* Bonus: what do you think the extra end="" parameter does?
