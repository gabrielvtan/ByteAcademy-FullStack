## Day 2 - Exercise 6 - While Input

* Write a program that asks a user to input an integer, and keeps asking the user to input integers until they input 'done'

* Afterward print the sum and the average of those numbers

#### Challenge
### Looking ahead: try and except

* Try out the following code in another file:

```python

try:
    v = int('x78')
    print("v+1 = {}".format(v+1))
except ValueError:
    print("Bad input")

```

* What do you think is going on here? Can you use this to improve the program for this exercise?
