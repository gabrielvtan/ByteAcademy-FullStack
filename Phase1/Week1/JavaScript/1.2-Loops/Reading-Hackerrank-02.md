* If you would like to work ahead on Hackerrank, you are more than welcome to. Look ahead in the Think Python table of contents if you need an introduction to topics not yet covered in the lectures. Lists especially are key to solving a great many of the problems.

### Reading

* Try to finish Chapter 2 of Think Python.

### cs50

* Harvard's CS50 courses are very high quality and available online. If you find you have the time to work on them while you are here, you are welcome to!

* They are available online at [[edx.org]]

* The "Understanding Computing" course is great if you don't consider yourself a 'computer person.' It is invaluable to have an understanding of what these machines are and how they work. Don't think of this as too basic, there's some great stuff in there.

* "Introduction to Computer Science" is a challenging course and a good supplement for students who are having an easier time with the Byte assignments.

* It is up to you as to whether or not completing the certificates is your goal. They aren't free.
