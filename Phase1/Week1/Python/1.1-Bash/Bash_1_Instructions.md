# STAR WARS The Death of the original Death Star (SPOILERS)

* Navigating your computer through terminal is an extremely important practically required skill to be a programmer. The following is an assignment where you will make / delete folders and files to help you get used to navigating your terminal and manipulating your files with bash commands.
* To get started, open up a terminal window. Use the `cd <directory_name>` command to change to a different directory, and use the `ls` command to list all files in the current directory. To go backwards (outwards) from the current directory, use `cd ..` and to return all the way to your home (outermost) directory, use the `cd` command by itself.
* If you get stuck, a good (and in-depth) cheat sheet for bash commands can be found at https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa/122b12050f5fb267e75f but try to do as much as possible from memory
* Try to complete all versions of the exercise to slowly ramp up the complexity of your command-line experience.

### Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope

***Follow the below story inside this folder in your terminal window***

* Create a directory called "star_wars"
* Change Directory into the "star_wars" folder
* Create a folder called "the_empire"
* Create a folder called "the_rebellion"
* Create a text file (txt) named "darth_vader"
* Open the darth_vader text file and add the text "I AM NOT LORD HELMET"
	* **Bonus points** if you add the text without opening the file
	* How can we add text to a file through a bash command?
	* Us programmers have a "force" too, it's called Google. (Using it properly can make anybody a jedi)
* Create another text file called "emperor"
* Enter the following text into the text file "emperor". 
	* "I used to be beautiful, but then I took an arrow to the knee"
* Move the "emperor" file and "darth_vader" file into "the_empire"
* 

***My Version***

* Create a directory called "star_wars"
* Make the following folders
	* "tatooine"
	* "millenium_falcon"
	* "death_star"
	* "x_wing"
	* "tie_fighter"
* Make the following text files (.txt)
	* "luke_skywalker"
	* "old_man_ben"
	* "han_solo"
	* "chewbacca"
	* "leia_organa"
	* "darth_vader"
	* "emperor_palpatine"
* Lets move "luke_skywalker" and "old_man_ben" to the "tatooine" folder
* Luke has found out old man ben is actually Obi Wan Kenobi. Change "old_man_ben" to "obi_wan_kenobi"
* Now they need to escape tatooine. Move "han_solo" and "chewbacca" in to "tatooine"
* While all this is happening the Sith lords are sitting nice and cozy inside their giant metal moon. Move "darth_vader" and "emperor_palpatine" inside the "death_star"
* Open up the Darth Vader file and input the following text; "I AM NOT LORD HELMET"
	* **Bonus:** Do this without opening the file. How can we add text to a file through the terminal. Use the force known as Google
* Back on tatooine the characters get on the fastest ship in the galaxy and take off to save the princess. Move all four files from tatooine into the millenium falcon
* The princess is also on the death star. Move "leia_organa" to the "death_star"
* Our heroes sneak onto the Death Star. Move all the files inside the "millenium_falcon" onto the "death_star" 
* They found the princess! but in the process Obi Wan was struck down by darth vader. Delete the "obi_wan_kenobi" file 
* Our other heroes retreat in anger. Move Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewwy into the "millenium_falcon"
* Alright the rebels have regrouped and come up with a plan to destroy the death star. Luke gets into an x-wing to use his sweet piloting skills. Move "leia" outside of the falcon but keep her alive in the star_wars folder. Move Luke into the "x_wing"
* Vader, also a legendary pilot, gets into the tie fighter to defend the death star. Move "darth_vader" out of the death_star and into the "tie_fighter"
* Luke uses those sweet farm boy desert skills and fires some torpedos into the core of the death star destroying it. **CAREFULLY** Delete the folder "death_star"
	* Remember to put a folder name when using the `rm -rf folder_name` command
	* **DO NOT** rm -rf by itself!!!!
