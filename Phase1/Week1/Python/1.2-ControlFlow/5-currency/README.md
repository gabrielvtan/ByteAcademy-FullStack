Float to Currency
==================

##### DESCRIPTION
---
Write a function that gives the number of American coins and bills needed to represent that number (rounded to the nearest 1/100, i.e. the nearest penny). 

As an exmaple, if the float is `12.33`, the result would be `1 $10`, `2 $1 bills`, `1 quarter`, `1 nickel` and `3 pennies`. 

Use the following as denominations for your currencies:

    Penny: 1 cent
    Nickel: 5 cent
    Dime: 10 cent
    Quarter: 25 cent
    One-dollar bill
    Five-dollar bill
    Ten-dollar bill
    Fifty-dollar bill
    Hundred-dollar bill
