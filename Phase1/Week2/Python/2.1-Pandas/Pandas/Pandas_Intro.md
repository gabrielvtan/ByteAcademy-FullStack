Warmup
======

In a separate notebook for each file, complete the first 30 of each of the following groups
of intro exercises to pandas and numpy:

Pandas: https://github.com/ajcr/100-pandas-puzzles/blob/master/100-pandas-puzzles.ipynb

Try not to look at the answers; this work is about not only learning numpy and pandas,
but also teaching you how to learn *any* outside library quickly (one of the most
important skills a python developer can have)


Pandas DataFrame Exercise
=========================

`Series` and `DataFrame` are the names Pandas gives to one-dimensional
and two-dimensional sets of data, respectively. We'll be reading NYC
police complaint data into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV.

Pandas provides a shockingly simple method to achieve this:
`.read_csv()`.

With Pandas, it's always best (fastest) to use a pandas library
method, rather than iterating through the data yourself. In this
exercise, we build a DataFrame from a New York City open data set,
"Complaints per Uniformed Officer". Use Pandas library methods to
find the answer to questions in `QUESTIONS.md`.

You won't get much help here beyond the pre-written code. The nature
of the exercise is such that to help would basically be giving you the
answer.

The good news is, Pandas is HUGE.

The bad news is, Pandas is HUGE.

We'll only be able to scrape the surface here, but the takeaway should
be that you've already learned enough to utilize powerful external
libraries, and when you have a more complex problem to solve with
Pandas, you'll be able to.
