# Phase 1 Assessment

This assessment will test the different skills you have learned throughout the course, so far.

You are expected to show an understanding of the different concepts that each part of the assessment tests. If you are stuck on something, move on and come back to it later.

Take a look through all of the assignments before starting, and map out how you're going to tackle the work assigned.

This is an assignment meant to be done individually.

You must turn off Slack.

Do NOT push to GitHub.

If you complete early feel free to do whatever you want, on your computer, go outside, and the like, as long as it does not distrupt the other students.

This is an OPEN BOOK assignment. Feel free to reference your class notes and utilize your GOOGLE FU.

You will be given eight hours to finish the assessment. After the time limit you will push to Github, and sit with an instructor to go over your code.
