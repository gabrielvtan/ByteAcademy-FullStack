Move the Zeroes
===============

Write a function that takes a list as an argument.

This list has a random integers.

Build a function that will move all the 0's to the end of the list
while maintaining the order of the non-zero elements.

Return the new format.

Example:
```
x = [0,1,0,3,12]

move_zeroes(x) == [1,3,12,0,0]
```

You must do this `in-place`. This means you cannot make a copy of
the list, and you may not mutate the list with methods like
`.push()` and `.pop()`.
