Deaf Grandpa, Raw
=================

Grandpa can't hear so well.

Build a web app where you can speak to Grandpa through a
[variable rule](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/quickstart/#variable-rules).

If the phrase you enter is written entirely in upper case, Grandpa
will repeat it back to you and say something witty.

If the phrase is lower case or mixed, Grandpa will say, "What? I can't
hear you!"

You'll need to use routes, variable rules, and plain ol' Python.
